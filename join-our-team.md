<p>Dear fellow real estate agent:</p>

<p>I understand you’re new to the business or you’ve been in the business for a few years and are still only averaging 10 to 15 deals per year.</p>

<p>Agents in your position often times struggle to take their career to the next level because they have no accountability or direction, and they pay for systems and products they don’t need. What happens if this problem goes unsolved? Well, that’s why studies show that 87% of all agents leave the business within the first two years. </p>

<p>To avoid becoming part of this statistic, they spend money without knowing what the results are. Either that, or they don’t have enough capital to properly utilize the right systems and procedures to begin with. Newer agents also tend to get bad advice in terms of what systems and procedures to use. In our business, you can’t just call a lead once and expect results.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, agents who stay on this path find themselves awake at 3 a.m. every night wondering where their next deal is coming from. And if they do have a deal in the works, they’re more nervous than they should be because they’re desperate for a commission check. If they’re desperate for a commission check, that means they’re not focused on generating and working leads. In other words, they’ll have “commission breath,” and eventually, they’ll have to find another career. </p>

<p>My name is Angie Cody, and I’d like to offer you a new path by inviting you to join my team. I’ve been in the business for 13 years, and I’m a top producer in my area. As a national real estate coach for Club Wealth, training and mentoring agents is something I do every day, and I want to do the same for you. I have the experience and top-notch technology you can tap into that won’t cost you anything out of pocket. </p>

<p>Once you’re on board, I’ll show you how to really work leads. You’ll also have access to the following features:
<ul class="indent">
<li>CRMs you can put your database into </li>
<li>Accountability programs, featuring daily huddles and weekly sales meetings</li>
<li>Team events and client events</li>
<li>Paid lead sources</li>
</ul></p>

<p>My plan goes beyond just providing leads, though. I also offer a comprehensive mentorship program. I keep my calendar free every day in case my team needs me, and I promise you’ll be able to call or text me anytime.  </p>

<p>We all want to make money, but being a part of our team means being a part of something. Aside from the systems and training, you’ll work in an environment that encourages you to succeed. The happier an agent is, the more money they make. </p>

<p>Of course, there are always alternatives to your situation. You can join a big-box brokerage, but they tend to offer certain systems and programs on a lesser scale, and you’ll have to compete against other brokers. Since I don’t work online leads, you’ll never have to compete against me. </p>

<p>You can also try paying for coaching, but that doesn’t come cheap, and joining my team means never having to pay any out-of-pocket expenses. Additionally, you can just give up real estate and embark on a new career. </p>

<p>We’re confident that you’ll see immediate success on our team, but don’t just take my word for it. Leslie joined our team a little over two years ago after trying her hand as a solo agent. Before she was referred to me, she was on the verge of finding a regular 9-to-5 job because she had no direction or training. Now, she’s my top agent and averages three to five closings per month. </p>

<p>She’s tapped into the leads, training, and systems I offer—the same thing I’m offering you. If you take me up on this offer, we’ll put you through our comprehensive onboarding process and, depending on your circumstances, you can be up and running in just a week.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this: If you show up to the office every day and are accountable, you’ll sell houses. If you work your sphere of influence and your leads, I guarantee you’ll sell 15 houses in your first year. </p>

<p>We only have a handful of spots to fill, so time is limited for you to take advantage of this opportunity. Call or email me today and let’s get started turning your career around and giving you the life you want. </p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p>Angie Cody</p>
