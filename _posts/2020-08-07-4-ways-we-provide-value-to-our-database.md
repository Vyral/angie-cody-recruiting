Here are some things that my team does to provide value to our database when reaching out to them:

**1\. We send out bi-monthly videos.** They range in topic from market updates to tips for buying or selling, and we send them out every two weeks.

**2\. Client events.** It could be “Cookies with Santa” or an Easter egg hunt. Whatever it is, it’s an opportunity to get involved with the community and see the people in our database face to face.

**3\. Homebuyer seminars.** Not everyone in our database is a homeowner. For those who aren’t now, but may be in the future, we want to be sure and educate them about the process through these seminars.

**4\. List of vendors.** We let our database know that we have a full list of preferred vendors/contractors, who often give discounted pricing. We know that if we send our clients to the people on this list, they will do a great job.

If you have any questions for me about how we touch our database or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
