<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in Knoxville?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 20,467 homes sold in the greater Knoxville and surrounding areas market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 110 homes last year.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Joining the Angie Cody Team resulted in a pivotal shift in my production and overall knowledge of the real estate industry. From buyer leads to training and support, my being on the team is indisputably the reason for my success."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Seriously, you always are cheering me on and wanting to see me succeed in whatever I’m doing, in real estate and life! You have provided the support, tough love, tools, training, and opportunities to allow me to grow and have a great first year in real estate. And the rest of the team has done the same as they follow your lead and example! Willing to show a home, answer a question, or share their expertise! I’m grateful for them and for you!"</p>

<!-- <p class="testimonial-text indent">“This training is great!” <span class="testimonial-author">- Bob</span></p> -->

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:angie@angiecody.com">angie@angiecody.com</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in Knoxville.</p>
